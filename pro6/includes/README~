CPSC 8270 project 5
Hui MA

This project is to parse simple function, and do if else.

If else : for boolean operator, set GreatBinaryNode, LessBinaryNode, NoteqBinaryNode, GreqBinaryNode, LesseqBinaryNode, EqeqBinaryNode for ">","<","!=",">=","<="
          Set IfNode to do logical action. if test is right, eval IfSuite, else eval elseSuite.

Def Function : set FuncNode for each function definition. Each FuncNode include std::string for Function name and SuiteNode for every statements in the function.

TableManager : it is a singleton.
	       the only one instance include a vector for Symboltable and another vector for FunctionTable and a int variable "currentScope".
	       use the manager, can check whether the functionname in the currentscope functiontable and whether variable name in the currentscope.
               the display() will show everything in the current functionTable and SymbolTable.

FunctionTable : std::map<std::string, Node*>
                function name and SuiteNode would save into the table.
		
Symboltable : std::map<std::string, Literval*>
		variable name and its value would save into the table.

ReturnNode : return value and break the current function.


MemoryLeakage : like project 4, don't need do any special action for it.
